****Caesar****

caesar(A,1)
A becomes B as A + 1 = B.


Notes of how to achieve:

Make a string of the alphabet / maybe string of uppercase value, check if there is a isUpper function.

Maybe a string of punctuation.
(Dont touch anything which isnt a letter????) or search for punctuation if it isnt find the letter? first option seems better.

Loop over sentence or string // change to array? split()

find the letter in the alphabet array and + the shift on to find new letter

use modulo to wrap around alphabet

should work with negative numbers.
